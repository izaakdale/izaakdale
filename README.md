I'm Izaak, a backend developer from the UK.

I currently write microservices in Go and deploy with the help of kubernetes. At the moment I am creating an ordering-app that provides some of the things a small order-process-deliver company might need, but it is mostly to just practice all of the things I use e.g. DynamoDb single table design, postgres db, protobuf and grpc, http routers.
