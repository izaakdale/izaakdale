I'm Izaak, a backend developer from the UK. 

<a href="http://www.izaakdale.com">izaadale.com</a> is a project I have recently completed. 
It was meant as a central location to showcase some of my photography and music production projects, as well as my a chance to practice some fullstack skills. I used a laravel API backend with a Vue.js frontend, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

I am currently learning Golang, intrigued by it's similarity to C (or C++ which I have worked with for 3 years in embedded systems), I am working on the auth side of a simple banking app.
